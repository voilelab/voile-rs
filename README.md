## How to build

```bash
cargo build
```

## How to Run

To run the program, you need to specify a settings directory. If you start the program without any arguments, it will use the default folder depending on your operating system:

* Linux: `$HOME/.config/Voile/`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Voile\`
* macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Voile/`

To start the program with a specific path to the configuration folder, you can run the following command:

```bash
./app [config_dir]
```

Replace `[config_dir]` with the desired path to the folder containing the configuration files. This allows you to override the default settings directory and specify a custom location for the configuration files.
